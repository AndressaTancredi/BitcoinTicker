# Bitcoin Ticker 🤑

## Goal

The objective of this App is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and 
providing a different user interface depending on the platform.
The App is a crypto currency price checking app. You can monitor your bitcoin investments on the move!

## What I learned

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.
